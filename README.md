# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!

### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual string if you lose!

***

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory, -`cd directory name` - and run the `game.py` file in a Python Terminal Window for macOS/Linux

The rules are the same as the classic game:
1. Papercovers the Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

_Choose your weapon wisely!_

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.
